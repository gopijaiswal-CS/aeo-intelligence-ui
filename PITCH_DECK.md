# StackIQ: Answer Engine Optimization Platform
## 5-Minute Hackathon Pitch

---

## 🎯 THE HOOK (30 seconds)

**Ask the audience:**
> "How many of you have asked ChatGPT or Claude for product recommendations in the last month?"

**The Reality:**
- 📱 Discovery has shifted from Google to AI assistants (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity)
- 🔍 Customers now ask AI for product reviews, comparisons, and recommendations
- ⚠️ **Problem:** Most brands are invisible in these AI-generated answers

---

## ❌ THE PROBLEM (45 seconds)

**What's Happening:**
- ✅ Brands invest heavily in content, SEO, and awareness campaigns
- ❌ But their products **don't appear** in AI-generated answers
- 💸 Result: Losing visibility, traffic, and sales to competitors

**Why This Happens:**
- LLMs rely on **structured, optimized, and trusted data**
- Most brand content isn't optimized for AI consumption
- Teams are flying blind:
  - ❓ Don't know what questions customers are asking
  - ❓ Don't know how AI models perceive their brand
  - ❓ Don't know why competitors appear while they don't

**This is the visibility gap.**

---

## 💡 THE OPPORTUNITY (30 seconds)

**The Paradigm Shift:**
- **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** → **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**
- It's no longer about ranking on page 1 of Google
- It's about being **the answer** that AI assistants cite

**Market Timing:**
- AI assistants reached 500M+ monthly users in 2024
- Enterprise content teams lack tools for LLM visibility
- First-mover advantage in the AEO category
